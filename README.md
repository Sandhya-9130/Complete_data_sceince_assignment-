# Complete_data_sceince_assignment-
This repository contains solutions for various Data Science assignments, implemented primarily in Python. The work covers a wide range of topics including data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning model development. Each solution is structured to follow a clear workflow: starting from understanding the dataset, identifying and handling missing values, visualizing data distributions, and applying appropriate statistical or machine learning techniques.

The repository includes code examples, visualizations, and explanations to help understand each step of the process. Techniques such as data scaling, encoding, outlier detection, and model evaluation are demonstrated using popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

These solutions are designed to serve as both a reference and a learning resource for students, beginners, or anyone interested in understanding practical applications of data science concepts in real-world datasets.
